However, it is the surface that is most worrisome. Of greatest concern are the lifting gesso, heavy soiling, and past attempts at restoration which are now deteriorating at a rapid rate. An old, heavy glue coating has darkened and shrunk, causing the gold to lift, and creating unsightly areas of cracking. Darkened and tarnished overpaint that attempt to cover areas of loss are obvious throughout the frame, and newer areas of gilding have been mechanically darkened in order to disguise the “newness”. Because the damage is so extensive and visible along the front edges, these areas will be entirely smoothed and regilded. In addition, the frame will undergo a thorough cleaning, correcting poor fills, consolidating lifting gesso, and adding a final protective coat, making for a much happier Dorothy Beridge.",
