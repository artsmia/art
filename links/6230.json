    "description": "Will the children in this wonderful genre painting ever find their way out of the darkness? With dirt and grime embedded in the thick, discolored layer(s) of varnish, only a good cleaning and near removal of all the old varnish will return light to the woods. Treatment will be a tricky process, however, as the painting is constructed with solvent-sensitive layers of glazes that lurk just beneath the old varnish. Once the old varnish is reduced as much as possible, a highly saturating varnish will be added to increase visibility and restore the jewel-tone colors to their original brilliance.",
