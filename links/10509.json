    "description": "This lovely landscape would be so much brighter, and you would actually be able to appreciate the long view, if the paint layers weren’t choking under layers of discolored dirty varnish and grime deposits. Areas of old retouching have darkened over time, altering the appearance of the sky and along the edges. These areas would be repaired and adjusted in order to improve the integration of the design and the painting’s overall color and tone. Small cleaning tests have indicated that treatment would result in a dramatic appearance.",
