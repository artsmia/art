If the Prodigal Son had too much fun while he was out being….well, prodigal, the frame is definitely paying the price. The overall condition is poor and unstable. Not only is the wood extremely warped, there are open joints, wood losses, insect damage, sections of replaced wood, lifting gesso – which is also lumpy and crumbling – and, last but not least, just a lot of good, old-fashioned soiling throughout the frame.\r\n\r\nDespite its calamitous condition, the frame can be fixed. Conservators will stabilize the structure, clean and consolidate the gesso, fill losses, gild and tone the fills, and add a protective coating.",
