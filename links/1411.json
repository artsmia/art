    "description": "<p>They were called \"wild beasts\" (<em>fauves</em>), for they didn't daintily dot a canvas with paint—they attacked it, aggressively brushing vivid color into mere suggestions of form. Henri Matisse was the leader of these artists, who transformed traditional painting by emphasizing the expressive power of color over the realistic depiction of their subject matter. It was the first revolutionary art movement of the 1900s: Fauvism. And although it seemed wild, even brutish, Matisse was aiming for balance, purity, serenity. <em>Three Bathers</em> is from Matisse's immediate post-Fauvist period, when he shifted toward radical simplification and used broad blocks of color to indicate land, water, and sky. Thick contour lines, both pictorial and sculptural, define the bathers and Matisse's struggle to reconcile multiple dimensions with two-dimensional design. </p>",
