    "description": "<p>Summer in Kyoto can be painfully hot and humid, thanks to the surrounding mountains that trap humidity in the city. Before air conditioning, residents were drawn to the natural cooling of the Kamo River. Restaurants installed wooden platforms over the water for outdoor dining with all the usual indoor entertainment.</p><p>This is an everyday scene, but not an everyday painting. Utagawa Toyohiro typically focused on a few figures or a landscape in his paintings, but here presents a richer narrative driven by multiple dynamic interactions. Toyohiro made relatively few paintings and used woodblock printing to make them more available and affordable for the masses.</p>",
