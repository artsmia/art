    "description": "If cleanliness is next to godliness, this Carthusian monk requires a good cosmetic cleaning to restore him and his yellowed habit to a state of blessedness.   However, beyond addressing superficial vanities through removal of old varnish and discolored retouchings, there are serious structural issues that also need to be addressed.   At some point, the canvas was enlarged by a different hand with the addition of strips of canvas to top and bottom.  This expanded composition was then backed with another fabric, and the adhesive used in this process has become degraded.  The required treatment would remove this old lining and added strips of canvas at top and bottom, thereby returning the painting to its original dimensions.  It would then be secured to a new stretcher.",
