Bunched together, like a team, they steady themselves, some balancing a hand on barbed wire, in confident poses that belie their brutal experiences. “Survivors gaze at photographer Margaret Bourke-White and rescuers from the United States Third Army during the liberation of Buchenwald, April, 1945,” read the caption when this photograph finally appeared in <em>LIFE </em>magazine on December 26, 1960, some 15 years after it was created. Today it remains one of the most widely circulated images of all time, picture of survival and a future.</p>",
