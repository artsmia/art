Areas of small losses and subsequent inpainting are present, but alas, the textured surface of these repairs do not match the surrounding original paint, and will need to be remedied. All extant varnish will be removed, old fills will be fixed and improved, and a final coat of highly saturating, non-yellowing varnish will be applied, thus significantly improving the appearance of this painting.",
