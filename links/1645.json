    "description": "Good things come in small packages, and this sweet little painting has much to offer. It’s actually in very good condition, too, given its age. The wood panel is stable, there is no overpainting, or flaking, or even overcleaning by some zealous 19<sup>th</sup> century restorer. In fact, the painting is entirely intact – with the exception of a greenish-yellow coat of varnish that covers the entire surface and completely obscures the more delicate passages of the artist’s brushwork. The surface is further affected by a grime layer that has embedded into the varnish layer – creating a haze of unsightly accretions, fingerprints and dirt. With your help, we can free this lively little picture from its discolored state and let it shine in the galleries.",
