    "description": "<p>To the Kongo people, St. Anthony was known as Toni Malau, or “Anthony of good fortune,” and he became popular at a time when the Kongo people needed all the luck they could get. In the 1700s, they were losing people to the trans-Atlantic slave trade even as a civil war tore them apart. A Kongolese noblewoman, Beatriz Kimpa Vita, began a movement declaring St. Anthony the savior of the kingdom. But Toni Malau did not save Beatriz Kimpa Vita. In 1706, she was captured by a Kongo ruler and burned as a heretic. The movement outlasted her death, however, and this ivory sculpture, carved over 200 years ago, is a testament to her teaching.</p>\n",
