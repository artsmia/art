    "description": "<p><i>A Book of Verses underneath the Bough<br /></i><i style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread, and Thou<br /></i><i>Beside me singing in the Wilderness<br /></i><i>Oh, Wilderness were Paradise enow.</i></p>\n<p>What a lovely sentiment! That bread and wine would go down much easier if the figures weren’t choking under a layer of varnish that has discolored to a medium amber color – hardly the effect that Sir Brangwyn was aiming for. Over the varnish, there is a moderate to heavy layer of grime and dirt. Let’s restore this painting to its original state, because we know that underneath that yellowed and filthy coating are a range of beautiful jeweled colors - creamy whites, spicy oranges, citrine yellows and bold blues. </p>",
