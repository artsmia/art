    "description": "This lovely little picture would appear so much more appetizing without its current layers of thick, yellowed, glossy varnish. During its history, someone decided to fix the painting by retouching a few areas of loss and abrasion. Unfortunately, the pigments were poorly matched; thus the areas of overpaint are considerably lighter and rather obvious, compared to the original paint surface. The previous attempts at restoration will be reversed, and a new, color-saturating layer of varnish will be applied to the surface of the painting, which will certainly serve to make this fruit bowl more appealing.",
