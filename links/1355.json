    "description": "<p>His vision is a dark one. Francis Bacon painted several portraits of popes (this is number six), and they all appear trapped, isolated and anguished—but beautifully painted. The portraits are based on Diego Velázquez’s celebrated portrait of Pope Innocent X, from 1650. And through his new way of depicting the human figure, Bacon showed what a portrait can be in the 20th century. In each of several studies he made for the painting, Bacon gave the pope a different face. Ultimately, he makes viewers feel as if they were behind the scenes, witnessing a private performance by a public figure.</p>",
