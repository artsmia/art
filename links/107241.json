    "description": "<p>To Brazilians and many others, he is the father of aviation. The Rio de Janerio airport is named for him, and on a monument there a winged figure soars above the crumpled bodies of those whose earlier attempts to fly didn’t go so well. Alberto Santos-Dumont was the contemporary and equal of the Wright brothers—except in America, where his buried legacy inspired Kehinde Wiley to depict the monument in a painting. He used people he met in Rio’s slums as models, men whose background might cause them to be forgotten just as Santos-Dumont has been left on the runway of history.</p>",
