    "description": "The last time this painting was touched by a conservator was in 1963. The painting has not been exhibited in the galleries for decades, due to its condition. Large areas of previous inpainting have gone matte, and have become obvious to even an untrained eye. The varnish is in extremely poor state, and has become embedded with a thick layer of dirt and grime. Ms. Dubuisson would benefit significantly from varnish and inpainting removal. It should also be noted that the current type of varnish is known to become extremely insoluble with age; an effect known as <i>crosslinking</i>, and a chemical change that is impossible to remove or reverse. Fortunately, this unsightly effect has yet to occur here, but we need your assistance in preventing such a ruinous outcome. This really is a lovely painting, and you know that all those Art in Bloom floral designers are always looking for new inspiration!",
