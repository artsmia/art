    "description": "This remarkable painting requires major treatment before it can be considered for gallery installation. Given its “unfinished” state, treatment requires some special considerations. Tension on the canvas is uneven, resulting in slackening around the corners which will need to be adjusted and tightened. Most worrying is the bottom right edge, where the paint surface was likely exposed to high humidity or moisture in the past, and is now actively lifting and flaking. Treatment of this area is of the highest priority, and the extant paint surface will be consolidated and secured to hinder further damage. The painting has also been coated with a thick, resin varnish which has discolored to a dark amber color, which disfigures the finer details and underdrawing. Fully treated, the painting will be an interesting and compelling addition to our 19<sup>th</sup> century American portrait collection.",
