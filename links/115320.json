    "description": "<p>What is the sound of two tusks clapping? Carved from a hippopotamus tusk, this pair of human hands was designed as a musical instrument, an ancestor of the modern claves. Clapped together as a rhythm instrument, the tusks would have accompanied an Egyptian orchestra of harps, pipes, lyres, and lutes. The noise of the clappers helped drive away hostile spirits, keeping celebrations joyful.</p>\n",
