    "description": "Visually, the overall landscape is badly obscured by a thick (now brittle) natural resin varnish that has discolored in a blotchy, uneven distribution of yellowing. There are areas along the edges where the pressure from the frame has shattered the varnish layer. The surface gloss is extremely uneven and marred with accretions, blanching, scrapes and scratches. In addition, there are the usual dirt and grime particles embedded in the old, natural resin varnish. The painting would benefit greatly from the removal of these layers, followed by a fresh application of stable, non-yellowing synthetic resin varnish. There are several poorly-executed attempts at retouching throughout that will require either toning or inpainting. As a result, Brueghelâ€™s delicately applied vibrant colors will appear as fresh as the day he finished it.",
