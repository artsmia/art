    "description": "Mr. Gray is actually rather yellow. While the original paint layer is intact and stable, the entire work has been surfaced with uneven layers of a thick resin varnish which has badly degraded and discolored to a deep amber-yellow over the decades. Removal of these varnish layers will reveal Mr. Gray’s lovely complexion and restore his crisp, starched whites to…well, white. Minor structural issues will be resolved, including the addition of a spacer to prevent abrasion of the canvas by its frame. After his treatment, we look forward to giving this fellow some deserved gallery time.",
