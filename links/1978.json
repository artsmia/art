Eugène Delacroix saw them in 1832 while traveling with the French ambassador, the Count de Mornay, who was negotiating a treaty of friendship with the sultan of Morocco. The pilgrims were eating glass and biting their own arms, among other acts of self-abuse, to draw attention to their religion. Vividly colored and vigorously brushed, Delacroix’s masterpiece captured the commotion, even though it was painted from memory five years later—a memory not easily forgotten.</p>",
