    "description": "<p><em>Curator’s Office</em> presents the story of Dr. Barton Kestle, a curator at Mia during the 1950s who simply disappeared. The door to his office was simply sealed behind a wall in a later museum renovation. Or so a visitor might think. Artist Mark Dion carefully crafted a narrative about an imaginary staff person who may have run afoul of the US government during the height of the Cold War. Kestle’s office provides a window into a bygone era and, perhaps, clues to help solve the mystery of the missing curator.&nbsp;</p>",
