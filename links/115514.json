    "description": "<p>It looks like a lumpy blob of dirt, more accident than art. But don’t let its humble looks fool you. The <i>boli</i> couldn’t have a larger, deeper purpose: it’s a portable altar and a symbol of the entire universe, imbued with spiritual energy. The <i>boli</i> came from the Bamana community in Mali and, as is often the case with indigenous African traditions, it was created by a team of artists, elders, and religious specialists to express in physical form some complex ideas and beliefs. Hidden deep inside is a small cloth doll. Over time, as bone, bark, nuts, soil, animal blood, and other natural materials are added to the <i>boli</i>, its spiritual energy increases.</p>\n",
