    "description": "<p>No one was dragging this picnic box into the grass to be covered with ants. Maybe a veranda. But as a refined piece of lacquer work, made more unique by its round shape at a time when most picnic boxes were square, it was likely always intended for display, a delicate decoration in the home of its wealthy owner. Perhaps the owner had a less fancy version for <em>hanami</em>, when well-to-do picnickers gathered under the cherry blossoms with sake poured from the tall container and rice balls and pickled vegetables from the separate containers of the stacked food trays.Â </p>",
