    "description": "This pair of Platzers (see previous painting, <em>Latona Turning the Lycian Peasants into Frogs</em>) haven’t gotten any gallery time in recent decades, due to heavy dirt and grime layers embedded into a discolored yellow coating of resin varnish. These unfortunate and unwelcome strata obscure the colors and original paint layers. Upon restoration, and in keeping with the treatments of Platzer’s <i>Four Seasons </i>series, we’ll coat the panel with microcrystalline wax and buff it, which will significantly increase color saturation.\r\n\r\nThese can be adopted individually, or as a pair.",
