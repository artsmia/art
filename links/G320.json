    "description": "<p>Northern Minnesota is an unlikely place for Asian lotus leaves and flowers, but they dominate this room from the William and Mina Prindle House in Duluth. John Bradstreet, who designed the room, perfected the aging and carving of cypress wood in his Minneapolis interior design company around 1900, based on a technique he learned in Japan. This unique woodwork, combined with fireplace tiles and light fixtures by Tiffany Studios and matching textiles, fill the homey historic interior with rich color and texture. The look went out of style around 1915, but Mrs. Prindle never redecorated, making this an interior that canâ€™t be seen anywhere else.</p>",
