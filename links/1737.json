    "description": "Small in stature, this painting could have a big effect – if it was properly conserved. Thankfully, the original paint layers are stable and intact, however, over the years, someone unnecessarily retouched the darker shadowy areas throughout the painting, probably in order to “enhance” the light and dark contrasts. Most regrettable is an unusually thick and badly degraded coat – actually <i>multiple</i> coats – of varnish. It is very soft, and has become deeply embedded with grime and dirt, thus dulling the appearance of the overall painting. Additionally, there is a large, conspicuous area of wrinkled varnish in the upper right quadrant. Simply stated, this painting needs your help! With proper cleaning, this painting would be a remarkable standout on a gallery wall.",
