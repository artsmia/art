    "description": "Oh, the drama! We’re not just talking about what’s happening between Mary Magdalen and the Angel. This goes deeper, folks. Right down to the tacking margins. The canvas on which this work is painted is entirely unstable, and the edges which are nailed to the stretcher are now brittle and torn. These edges require linen strips in order to stabilize and properly retension the canvas across the stretcher. Not only are there structural issues that need to be addressed, but the paint surface is in big trouble, too. There is a thick layer of disfiguring yellowed varnish, and several areas of retouching that have now discolored and become noticeable. In fact, over the centuries, it seems that this painting has been doctored several times. There are several large areas of retouching that were probably unnecessary, and only added in order to brighten the picture up – again, thanks to layers of dirty varnish. Small tests have indicated that cleaning this painting would result in a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">dramatic</span> improvement.",
