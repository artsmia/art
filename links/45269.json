    "description": "<p>This is no mere mat. It is a portable mosque. Like a mosque, this mat functions as a sacred space for prayer. A faithful Muslim prays five times a day: at dawn, noon, afternoon, sunset, and evening. Because going to a mosque to pray five times a day is not always possible, prayer mats were designed for the worshipper on the go.Â  The three spires in the center of the mat are a reference to Islamic architecture, and associate the mat with the mosque.</p>\n",
