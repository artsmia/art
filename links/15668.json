    "description": "Historically significant, this painting was gifted to the museum as part of the Works Project Administration. Given the subject and local interest, it would be wonderful to have the painting cleaned, repaired and placed on view. Structurally, the painting requires removal from its current stretcher, and the edges require careful strip lining before reattaching the canvas to a new, more supportive stretcher. Layers of dirt, grime and old, amber-colored varnish will be removed, and small losses will be filled, inpainted and textured to match the original paint. If youÂ  like dramatic reveals, this is the project for you!",
