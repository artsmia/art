And when his cue arrives, he forcefully strikes the tight animal skin with a calloused hand to create a sharp pop.&nbsp;</p><p>This is an elaborately decorated <em>ōtsuzumi&nbsp;</em>, a large drum, one of four instruments integral to traditional Japanese Noh theater. This type of drum is also used in <em>kabuki </em>theater, <em>gagaku</em>, and folk songs. <em>Kabuki </em>is a traditional style of Japanese theater that has risqué, or wild,&nbsp;themes. <em>Gagaku </em>is imperial court music and dancing.</p>",
