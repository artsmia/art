    "description": "<p>He has a name you could only dream of: Daiitoku Myōō, Wisdom King of Awe-inspiring Power. He has the body to back it up—six heads, arms, and legs—and a great ride: a water buffalo bull. Looks real enough, too, especially the bull—wood sculptures in the Kamakura period were known for their remarkable realism. In the Buddhist pantheon, the Wisdom King is a god to reckon with, one of the wrathful, ferocious Myōō deities whose mythical knowledge can help overcome earthly passions. These gods came from India along with Esoteric Buddhism (Daiitoku being derived from the Hindu death god Yamantaka), though it’s not known in which temple this Daiitoku was originally housed. </p>",
