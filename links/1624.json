Repairs and joints have opened over time and there are numerous cracks and losses on the carvings, scrolls, and sides of the frame. In addition, the frame is very grubby, with discolored overpaint, fingerprints, darkened glue, and accumulated soot. Oh my! Restoration will include consolidating lifting gesso, removing the overpaint, and a super- thorough cleaning. The loose joints will be tightened, and losses will be filled, gilded, and toned. In the end, this frame will look shiny and new, plus it will also be stable!",
