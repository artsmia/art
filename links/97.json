    "description": "<p>Itâ€™s a rich millennia-old mystery: Why was a teenage girl named Tashat buried with the skull of an unknown adult between her legs? And why are so many of her bones broken? X-rays and CT scans also reveal a poorly embalmed body and missing funereal jewelry, raising questions about those who prepared Tashat for the afterlife.</p>",
