    "description": "<p>Mami Wata—exotic spirit, temptress of men, provider of wealth—might be wearing snakeskin if she wasn’t already draped in serpents. She’s a water spirit (her name means “Mother of Water” in Pidgin English), cruising the ocean like a mermaid/snake charmer. Although she first appeared in West Africa many centuries ago, this particular image of her became popular in southern Nigeria in the early 1900s. This unusually large figure was probably made in the early 1950s—dig the A-line skirt and trendy shoes. Street-wise and fashion-forward, she’ll share the secrets of her success with anyone looking to get a stylish leg up in the modern world and willing to pay her price: gifts and more, sometimes even celibacy.</p>",
