    "description": "<p>This large painting suffers from a thick layer of grime and dust – and the heavily impastoed paint surface and generous brushwork will make cleaning a time-consuming effort. In addition, there are a few areas of significant paint loss, where the paint has either flaked, or been picked, off of the canvas. These losses will be carefully filled and matched in a reversible process. No varnish will be applied to the surface, keeping with the artist’s original intent. To complete the project, we will also create “one less” distracting inner frame to support the heavy canvas. </p>",
