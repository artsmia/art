    "description": "This painting needs a bit of TLC. Itâ€™s been installed in the galleries periodically, but it can really shine with some structural and cosmetic treatment. There is a small tear in the canvas that needs mending, canvas tension needs to be tightened, and several scattered losses and tiny puncture sites require treatment. Since the painting is unvarnished, as the artist intended, it will stay that way. The relatively thick layer of surface grime, accretions and dirt that the painting has picked up over the years will be carefully removed.",
