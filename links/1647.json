    "description": "Eliezer would benefit enormously from a thorough cleaning. There are scattered areas of retouching and losses underneath a layer of synthetic resin varnish that has yellowed significantly over time. In addition, a layer of grime has also embedded itself into the resin layer, dulling the appearance of the painting.\r\n\r\nTreatment involves removal of the varnish and old areas of retouching, careful inpainting of pigment losses, and applying a new coat of non-yellowing varnish. This will markedly improve the appearance of the work by renewing its color saturation, resulting in bolder reds, brighter whites, and a blue – not brown-blue – sky. After all, the name Eliezer means “God is my help”. Let’s do a good deed in turn, and help Eliezer.",
