The painter known as El Greco loved this scene from the Bible.<em>  And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those who sold doves. And He said to them, “It is written, my house shall be called a house of prayer; but you are making it a robber’s den.” </em>(Matthew 21:12) His multiple takes on the subject mark his evolving artistic style, each subsequent version being more abstract and stylized.</p>",
