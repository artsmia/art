    "description": "<p>The cabaret is swinging—hard enough that time has lost meaning and modern sophisticates consort with mythological figures. Amid these pleasure-seekers stand two young people carrying candles. The girl is oblivious to the clamor, steadfastly waiting; the boy is blindfolded but determined to find her—they have a predestined connection. These two give the painting its title, after the old game in which a blindfolded child stumbles through the darkness to find and “tag” other children. When asked if the couple would ever find each other, the artist Max Beckmann said “Perhaps; let us hope it.”</p>",
