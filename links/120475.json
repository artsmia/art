But this halberd was intended only for ceremonial display, a somewhat threatening conversation piece, in the home of a family known for its pomp and circumstance—and its reliance more on marriage than warfare to expand its dominion. It was made for Ferdinand I, the Holy Roman Emperor and a member of the renowned House of Habsburg, one of the most prominent ruling families of Europe for more than 600 years.  </p>",
