    "description": "Diogenes stalked the streets of Athens with his lantern, looking for an honest man. But an important part of the legend is that he also walked those streets in <i>daylight</i>. While there is no blue sky in Lothâ€™s painting, there are certainly abrasions from aggressive cleaning over the centuries, areas of retouching, and a moderate layer of grime embedded in the varnish. Treatment would resolve these issues, and do much for the overall design of the painting, since the dark passages (of which there are many!) are obscured and unreadable due to poor color saturation.",
