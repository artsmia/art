This gilded Salvator Rosa-style frame is structurally stable but the surface is not; there are gouges, cracks, and areas of lifted and lost gesso and gold. The entire frame is dirty and features numerous attempts at repair over the decades, some of which is bronze overpaint that has tarnished to a brownish-green color – yuck! Restoration will include a thorough cleaning and stabilizing of the surface. Lifting gesso will be consolidated, the tarnished overpaint will be removed and areas of loss will be filled and regilded. After such a thorough treatment, the frame will better serve the painting in its bringing of glad tidings!",
