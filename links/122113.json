    "description": "<p>Who are these two Chinese figures, one hunched over a rock, preparing ink while his friend enscribes a poem on the wall of a cave? They are Kanzan (known an Hanshan in Chinese) and Jittoku (known as Shide in Chinese). They were poets, monks, hermits, and misfits during China’s Tang Dynasty (618–907), and were celebrated for their religiosity and poetry first in China and later among Zen Buddhists in Japan.  </p>",
