    "description": "<p>What does paradise look like? Take a close look at this hanging scroll, illustrated with images of paradise that inspired hours of meditation for followers of Amida Buddha, the central figure of Pure Land Buddhism. This <em>Contemplation or Visualization Sutra</em>, one of the faith’s three main scriptures, describes paradise in rich detail, from Amida Buddha himself to the ponds, gardens, and jeweled palaces. And it provides clear instructions for getting there in the next life: visualize every detail of the place in meditation. Pure Land Buddhism attracted many followers in Japan and other parts of Asia with its message that paradise is within anyone’s reach.</p>",
