    "description": "<p>The ailing Germanicus—born Nero Claudius Drusus—earned his honorary name as a tenacious Roman general, famed for his brutally successful campaigns in the early first century against the tribes of Germania. He inspired such loyalty among his troops and the citizens of Rome that his adoptive father, the Emperor Tiberius, dispatched him to a distant post in Syria. The general’s mysterious death at 34 fueled suspicions that Tiberius had him poisoned and sparked grief and anger across the Roman Empire. More than 1,500 years later, French painter Nicolas Poussin sought to stir those feelings anew, framed in the stoic restraint of the classical past.</p>",
