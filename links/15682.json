    "description": "This was a big surprise! We removed the backing board of the painting in order to assess the full condition of the object, and found a complete, fully-realized composition on the reverse. Even better, the hidden painting was the more interesting and compelling image. After much discussion, we have elected to reorient the painting in order to display the “new” painting. This will require careful strip lining, a new custom stretcher, and a new frame. We will also have to relax the existing folds and creases that resulted from the artist flipping the canvas over and re-using it for another composition. Dirty varnish and grime will be removed from both sides of the canvas.  It is important to note that the changes we are proposing will not cover or in any way damage the smaller composition. Who knows what surprises lurk behind the canvases in our museums? One by one, we’re discovering them, with your help.",
