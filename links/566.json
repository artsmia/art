    "description": "<p>Step right up, don’t be shy, come and see the amazing wonders woven into this surreal tapestry titled <em>The Camel</em>.  An Eastern king awaits entertainment while exotic marvels are presented to him—peacocks, leopards, rope-walking acrobats, musical delights, and (the tapestry’s namesake) a camel.  But who really is being delighted by this scene?  The king, awaiting the “exotic” and fantastical entertainments on display or the French aristocrats in whose home this tapestry hung? While not an accurate depiction of Eastern culture, this tapestry is a truthful representation of Western fascination with the lands beyond the borders of Europe.  </p>",
