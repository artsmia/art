    "description": "<p>This small screen of racy scenes was best enjoyed while lying on one’s side—in bed. The artist depicts a makeshift theater on the fringe of Kyoto’s pleasure district, with its brothels and courtesans—indeed, he idealizes it with plenty of gold leaf and tidy details. The lead actress is likely the incomparable Izumo no Okuni, whose bawdy performances launched <em>kabuki </em>theater. While the artist would have been paid handsomely for a piece made with such fine skill and materials, he neglected to sign it—perhaps because he didn’t want his name associated with what was then a risqué subject.</p>",
