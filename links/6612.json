    "description": "<p>Most people don’t ride deer. Not in Japan, anyway—with one exception. According to Shinto belief, the first deity honored at Kasuga Shrine flew there on the back of a white deer, a transportation option reserved for gods. The shrine was built in 768 by the powerful Fujiwara family on the plains below Mount Mikasa, near Nara. The mountain appears here in the distance, while clouds suggesting the divine deer’s heavenly origin swirl around its feet and a golden disc rests atop it within a sacred tree. This painting is a mandala, a symbol of the universe derived from Hindu and Buddhist traditions.</p>",
