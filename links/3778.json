    "description": "<p>Bling fit for a king. Heavy with bead and shell pendants, this <i>yet</i> belt was once part of the elaborate outfit worn by the king of the Kuba people in the Democratic Republic of Congo. None of the pendants match, a show of creativity and innovation prized by Kuba leaders. In fact, the notoriously fashion-conscious kings often help create patterns and symbols that become part of their personal “brand,” broadcasting authority and influence. Only the king and a few select members of his entourage can wear his signature designs.</p>\n",
