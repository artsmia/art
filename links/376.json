This is the god Shiva in his Nataraja form, the embodiment of his supreme powers. The sculpture is Mia’s first donated work of Indian art and one of the cornerstones of the collection. Ancient texts speak of Shiva’s dance, <em>ananda tandava</em> (literally translated as “furious bliss”), as wreaking havoc and destruction—sending false prophets scampering and humiliating rival gods and goddesses.&nbsp;</p>",
