It was supposed to. The architectural firm of McKim, Mead and White built the model after winning the 1911 competition sponsored by the Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts (the parent organization of Mia), and its ambition reflects the Societyâ€™s plans for a cultural center, or Institute of Arts, including not just a museum but an art school and orchestra hall. Only a fraction of it was built.</p>",
