## 1.1.5

Bugfixes:

  - Adding webpack under devDependencies, as it's no longer automatically installed as a peer dependency
  - Bump dependencies

## 1.1.4

Bugfixes:

  - Bumping to react-side-effect 1.0.2
  - Updating peer dependences for react 0.14.0-rc1
  - Bump dependencies

## 1.1.3

Bugfixes:

  - Externalize react-side-effect
  - shouldComponentUpdate compares props with deep equal
  - handleClientStateChange compares DOM changes with deep equal to prevent unnecessary DOM changes
  - Warning users to not nest children in their Helmet components.  We found that when Helmet contains children, those children are part of the props that are compared in shouldComponentUpdate.  And this causes unnecessary renders as the props are always different, even with the same Helmet title/meta/link props.
  - Adding react-helmet-example to README
  - Bumping to react-side-effect 1.0.1
  - Bump dependencies.

## 1.1.2

  - Allow all React 0.14 betas in peer dependencies
  - Bump dependencies.
  - Fixed invariant check in CreateSideEffect

## 1.1.1

Bugfixes:

  - Externalizing of React helpers - exenv, invariant, shallowequal
  - Using ES6 collections to manage tags
  - Bumping peer dependency for use in React 0.14.0-beta.
  - Title encoded when being rendered on the server
  - Import a smaller subset of core-js modules instead of the whole shim.

## 1.1.0

Bugfixes:

  - Re-organization of unit tests.

## 1.0.1

  - Typo in README - use Helmet.rewind()
