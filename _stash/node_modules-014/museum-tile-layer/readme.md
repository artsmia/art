Hi! I am a Leaflet plugin to serve up tiled photographs at high
resolution.

[Example of a large image](https://artsmia.github.io/museumTileLayer/)
[Thousands of images from the @artsmia collection](http://collections.artsmia.org/search/image:%22valid%22%20restricted:0)

# Companion code

* [Implementation of zoomable images on `collections.artsmia.org`](https://github.com/artsmia/art/blob/master/src/artwork.js#L158)
* [Tilesaw](https://github.com/artsmia/tilesaw) processes images from our API into zoomable files using `vips`
