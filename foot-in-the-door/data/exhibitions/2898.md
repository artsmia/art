Mia’s Creativity Academy is a multiple-visit program for fourth-grade students, designed to foster creativity, critical thinking, communication, and collaboration. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the program went virtual for the 2020-2021 academic year. In replace of an in-person exhibition, students submitted artwork to their teachers and the images have been made available here.


Mia launched Creativity Academy in 2013–14. Since then the program has expanded to include 485 fourth graders from up to twenty classrooms in six schools: Saint Paul Music Academy and Battle Creek Elementary in St. Paul, and Andersen United, Bethune Community School, Hennepin Elementary, and Prodeo Academy in Minneapolis.


The program curriculum normally includes four 90-minute lessons, two at school and two at Mia, taught by experienced arts educators. This year students met virtually across five 60-minute lessons. During each lesson, students discuss an artwork in Mia’s collection, create original artworks, and engage in creative writing. Each year, the program culminates in a student exhibition at Mia.
