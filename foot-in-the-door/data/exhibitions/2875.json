The accompanying album grew from Mkali’s in-depth research on the work of each artist, and approaches their individual visual practice as a means to access and articulate a collective Black consciousness that transcends time and space. \n\nHere, images, words, and music combine to explore themes of identity, culture, spirituality and power through the embodiment of Black lived experience.  As Chaka Mkali explains: \n\nRituals of Resilience <i>is about the act of survival under intense pressure and heat. A place to hide when being in your body isn’t safe. A reimagining of new worlds and possibilities. The creative culture of Indigenous and diasporic ethnic groups of African descent surviving and dismantling 400 years of white supremacy. . . through a visceral fabric of repetitious intentional movements, vibrations, gatherings, acts, symbols, and codes.</i>"
